The [link](https://github.com/r-kells/scream) to the official scream repository to learn more.

An example utilization of the `scream` monorepo manager to show off some of the features.
All files / folders you see in this repository were automatically generated by `scream`.

### Link to all packages we created automatically [documentation](docs.md)

Here are the commands to reproduce this repo.

## Setup

`scream init` sets up an empty repository with all the basic files you need for you python monorepo.

```bash
mkdir monorepo
cd monorepo

scream init
> Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/rk/py/scream-example/.git/
> INFO - Done!
> Create a new package with `scream new <namespace>.<package_name>`

scream new company.common
> INFO - Created project `company.common`

scream new company.project
> INFO - Created project `company.project`

# Remember to have python 3.6 installed (the default, you can change it.)
pyenv local 3.6.7

# Run all tests!
scream test --all

# Commit our initial project structure.
git add .
git commit -m "initial monorepo setup"

# Your repo here... 
git remote add origin git@github.com:r-kells/scream-example.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Dependencies

```bash
# Start working on a new feature.
git checkout -b link-packages
```
Add the following to `project/setup.cfg` `[options]`

This will make the package `project` depend on the package `common`.
By using explicitly defined dependencies `scream` will know how to build and test your repository.

While we are add it, add `flask` as a dependency.

`dependency_links` is not mandatory, but if you want to install `company_project` package
directly using pip you will need to add it. 

```ini
install_requires = 
    company_common 
    flask

dependency_links =
    git+ssh://git@github.com/r-kells/scream-example.git@master#egg=company_common-0#subdirectory=common
```

## Testing

`scream test` will use git to automatically detect which packages need to be tested.

If you change a package that is a dependency for other packages in this repository, 
they will all be tested to make sure they are compatible with the changes.

The test command uses [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
to test all python versions specified in your [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/r-kells/scream#configuration).
 
# Testing a single package

```bash
# Run scream test to make sure we didn't break anything
scream test
> INFO - The following packages have changes compared since branch: `link-packages`:
        company_project

> INFO - Packages that require testing:
        company_project
> ...
> ...
> ...

> py36-company_project: commands succeeded
> congratulations

# Save and push changes
git commit -am "linked"
git push --set-upstream origin link-packages

git checkout master
git pull origin link-packages
git push
```

## Installing your package

### `pip install` a single package with dependencies

At this point we can `pip install` a package.

```bash
pip install 'git+ssh://git@github.com/r-kells/scream-example.git@master#subdirectory=project' --process-dependency-links

> Successfully built company-project
> Installing collected packages: company-project
> Successfully installed company-project-0.0.1
```

### `scream install`

If you are using CD/CI, you'll probably clone your monorepo into an environment for testing / deploying.
Using scream install, local dependencies are resolved automatically, without needing `dependency_links`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:r-kells/scream-example.git

scream install company_project
> INFO - Installing package: `company_project`...
> INFO - Installation complete.
```

# Scream

It's objective is to ease the creation, testing, and deploying of multiple python packages in a single repository.
To ensure non-overlapping names with PYPI, this tool forces you to use namespace packages.
Namespaces are defined according to python's
[pkgutil-style](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#pkgutil-style-namespace-packages).

## Why use Scream?

- Scream holds all packages to the same standards
    - Enforces consistent styling.
    - Enforces consistent testing.
    - Enforces consistent documentation.

- Uses [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to setup virtualenvs for isolated testing across python versions.
- Pre-commit hooks to help prevent those gosh darn mistakes.

### Problems with most monorepos

1. Testing & CI/CD pipeline can become slow with many packages.

    The other available solutions are:
    - Use a build tool like [Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/index.html) or [Bazel](https://bazel.build/).

    These tools are extremely powerful, but sometimes are overkill, and introduce a fair amount of overhead to manage.

2. Installing intra-monorepo package dependencies is hard with a private repositories.

    The available solutions are:
    - Have all your packages distributed publically.
    - Host a private PYPI index.
    - pip install using [dependency links](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dependencies.html).

### How scream works
Scream aims to cause as little overhead as possible for managing your monorepo.
No fancy third party configuration or private PYPI repositories.

Scream uses the existing python packaging requirements to resolve intra-monorepo dependencies,
and `git` to detect what's changed since the parent branch.

For example:

cat [setup.cfg](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#configuring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files).
```ini
[metadata]
name = company_packageA
version = 0.0.1
description = Your package description!

[options]
packages = find:
install_requires =
    company_packageB
```
If you make a change to `company_packageA` then run tests...
```bash
> scream test --dry-run

The following packages have changes compared since branch: `master`:
        company_packagea

Packages that require testing:
        company_packagea
        company_packageb
```

## Commands

* `scream new <package_name>` - Creates new template package.
* `scream test [--dry-run][--all]` - Tests packages and package dependents that have changed.
* `scream install <package_name>` - Installs a package.
* `scream build` - Builds a python wheel and bundles it with all it's dependencies as wheels.

## Quickstart
> By default packages are tested against python 3.6.x, which means you have it available on your PATH.
If you about different versions, please see the [configuration options](#Configuration).

```bash
> mkdir mymonorepo
> cd mymonorepo

> scream init
Done!
Create a new package with `scream new <namespace>.<package_name>`

> scream new com.packagea
Created project `com.packagea`

> scream new com.packageb
Created project `com.packageb`

> scream test --all
Running tests...

> coverage report
```

## Using your monorepo packages
The two common ways you would install packages from this monorepo are:

1. Using `scream build` in your CI tool to build packages and ship them to your machines.
2. Standard pip install individual packages to any machine from private or public github repos.

If your repository is *public*, you can simply install a subpackage anywhere using:
```bash
pip install 'git+ssh://git@github.com/ORG/REPO.git@master#subdirectory=examplea'
```

If your repository is *private*,
you need a few extra steps to make sure packages that depend on other packages in this monorepo can be installed.

1. Specify `dependency_links` in the `setup.cfg` for each 'local' dependency:
```ini
dependency_links =
    git+ssh://git@github.com/ORG/REPO.git@master#egg=examplea-0#subdirectory=subpackages/examplea
```
2. pip install as before, but specifiy the flag `--process-dependency-links`
```bash
pip install 'git+ssh://git@github.com/ORG/REPO.git@master#subdirectory=examplea' --process-dependency-links
```

## Configuration
1. In your packages `setup.cfg` the variable `python_requires`
determines which versions of python your package will be tested against.
- Ex. python_requires = 2.7, 3.6, 3.7
    >  Note: the python versions you intend to test must be available on your path.
